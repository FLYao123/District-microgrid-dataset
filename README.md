The proposed approach is evaluated on an integrated district dataset which is main from Chong Aihâ€™s MSc project, accessible on Github [1]. This open dataset contains hourly load, market price and PV generation data of a microgrid in US. Also, the hourly carbon intensity data is from [2] with some modifications, which provides some carbon emission and intensity information related to the US electricity system. Some necessary operations (such as scaling and cleaning) have also been performed on the two datasets. 

This dataset  is used in paper 'A Comprehensively Dynamic Power Optimization of District Microgrid Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning'(under review).
