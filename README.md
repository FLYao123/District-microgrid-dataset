This is an integrated district dataset which is main from Chong Aih’s MSc project, accessible on Github [1]. This open dataset contains hourly load, market price and PV generation data of a microgrid in US. Also, the hourly carbon intensity data is from [2], which provides some carbon emission and intensity information related to the US electricity system. Some necessary operations (such as scaling and cleaning) have also been performed on the two datasets.
